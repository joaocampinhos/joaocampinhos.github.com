    My name is Jo√£o Campinhos and I'm a Computer Science student at <a href="http://www.unl.pt/en/">Universidade Nova de Lisboa</a>. I live in Portugal, but I'm planning to move as soon as I finish my degree. I want to be a front end developer on a startup full of hungry and foolish people.
  </p>
  <p>
    I developed a huge love for front end development, and that's what I want to do. All the work between a designer and a front end dev to create the most flawless experience to the user fascinates me. I'm obsessed with little details and I'm always looking to perfect things.

    Since you are here, take a look at my blog, where I write about technology and web development. You can follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/jcampinhos">Twitter</a> (although I don't use it that much), and check my code on <a href="http://github.com/joaocampinhos">Github</a>. Also feel free to Email me at <a href="mailto:joao@campinhos.pt">joao@campinhos.pt</a>.

  <h3>About the site</h3>
  <p>
    As I said before, I'm always seeking for perfection, and that means this site is a Work in Progress, and will probably stay that way forever.
  </p>
  <p>
    This site is powered by <a href="">Jekyll</a> and hosted on <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>. The entire source code is available <a href="https://github.com/joaocampinhos/joaocampinhos.github.com">here</a>.
    It's my first project of the twelve that I'm doing on 2013, but its going to be updated on a regular basis.
