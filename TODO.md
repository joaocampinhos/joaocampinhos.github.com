+ change the way the menu is done                   (yeah... it's so ugly right now :/ )
+ Create a projects page                           
+ Improve the layout                                (Dunno how, but there is always room for improvment)
+ Change the syntax highlight to a better theme     (This is be the last time... so many colors to change :X)
+ Fix Paginator issues                              (I will never figure this out...)
