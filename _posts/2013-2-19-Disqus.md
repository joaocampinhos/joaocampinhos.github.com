The to do list for my blog is not big, but it does have some important stuff that needs to be done. **Comments** is a nice example.
This is really important to me because since I don't receive much feedback, every piece of it counts. I also think that comments can promote discussion, which is always good.

## Disqus VS Branch

I was not sure about wether I should use [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) or [Branch](http://branch.com/) but, after some research my decision was quite easy to make.
Although both Disqus and Branch are fairly easy to implement, and they both have a nice design, Branch isn't quite appropriate for blogs. At least not as a comment system.

Branch has its strenghts, but for my particular case I decided to go with Disqus because it's a more traditional system.

## About February

I developing my own css framework. It will only be a draft with very few features but I already have some things that I want to add:

+ Reset (Probably a custom version of normalize.css)
+ Typography (basic stuff)
+ Grid (responsive and not responsive)
+ Some nice abstractions like `nav` and other stuff that might come in handy
+ Design (but with an easy way to turn it off)

So, as you can see, for now it will be some basic stuff useful for my own projects. To be honest, if I wanted a framework full of features, I would use [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) or [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) right?

I'm using [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) because it's awesome, and i'm naming it [Tophat](https://github.com/joaocampinhos/Tophat) because I like top hats.
