I should write here more often. It's actually quite easy to find a interesting subject but I tend to have a hard time starting the actual post. The lack of posts gives the impression that I forgot my project of creating 12 things on 2013, but so far I've done:

+ My website. it was just a blank page with my name on it
+ A CSS framework available [here](http://campinhos.pt/Tophat/)
+ A Markdown [text editor](http://campinhos.pt/words/) that uses some crazy HTML5 API's

Three months, three projects. So far so good right? But since I don't have the time I thought I would, the actual quality of my side projects are not top notch like I wanted them to be. Some things were rushed and some features I couldn't build on time and that reflects on the actual product.

That's why in this month (April) I'm not going to develop anything. Instead I'm going to improve what I already created:

##April To-do list

+ Improve my website and blog (write some more)
+ Officially launch Tophat.css and finish those damn docs
+ Add some more features to words
+ Update some old projects and open source them.

in addiction to all of that, and since I'm putting more love and care into my stuff, I'm also going to put my projects on [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and other sources to get some feedback. I'm only doing that when I'm 100% sure of the quality of my work so I may delay that a little bit.
